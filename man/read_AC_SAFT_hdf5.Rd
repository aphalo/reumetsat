\usage{
read_AC_SAFT_hdf5(
  files,
  data.product = NULL,
  group.name = "GRID_PRODUCT",
  vars.to.read = NULL,
  fill = NA_real_,
  verbose = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{character A vector of file names, no other limitation in length
than available memory to hold the data.}

\item{data.product}{character Currently only "Surface UV" supported.}

\item{group.name}{character The name of the 'group' in the HDF5 files.}

\item{vars.to.read}{character A vector of variable names. If `NULL` all the
variables present in the first file are read.}

\item{fill}{numeric The R value used to replace the fill value used in the
file, which is retrieved from the file metadata, and also used to fill
missing variables.}

\item{verbose}{logical Flag indicating if progress, and time and size of
the returned object should be printed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns named `"Date"`, `"Longitude"`,
  `"Latitude"`, the data variables with their original names, and
  `"QualityFlags"`. The data variables have their metadata stored as R
  attributes.
}
\description{
The dates are decoded from the file names, expecting these to be
  those set by the data provider. The grid is expected to be identical in all
  files that are imported in a call to `read_O3MOUV_hdf5()`, and grid
  subsetting is currently not supported. If not all the files named in the
  argument to `files` are accessible, an error is triggered early. If the
  files differ in the grid, an error is triggered when reading the first
  mismatching file. Missing variables named in `vars.to.read` if detected
  when reading the first file, are filled with the `fill` value, otherwise
  they trigger an error when an attempt is made to read them.
}
\details{
Import gridded daily "offline products" data files from EUMETSAT AC SAF
(Atmospheric Composition Monitoring) in HDF5 format. Currently only the
"Surface UV" data product files as downloaded from the FMI server are
supported.
}
\note{
The constraint on the consistency among all files to be read allows
  very fast reading into a single data frame. If the files differ in the grid
  or set of variables, this function can be used to read the files
  individually into separate data frames. These data frames can later be
  row-bound together.

  When requesting the data from the EUMETSAT AC SAF the FMI server at
  \url{https://acsaf.org/} it is possible to select the range of latitudes
  and longitudes and the variables to be included in the file. This is more
  efficient than doing the selection after importing the data into R. The
  data are returned as a .zip compressed file containing one HDF5 file for
  each day in the range of dates selected. For world coverage each of these
  files can be as large as 10 MB in size depending on how many variables
  they contain. These files in HDF5 format are binary files so the size
  in RAM of a `data.frame` containing one-year of data can be a few 10's of
  GB.

  This function's performance is quite fast as long as there is enough RAM
  available to hold the data frame and the files are read from a reasonably
  fast SSD. It has been tested by importing one-year's worth of data with
  worldwide coverage on a PC with 64GB RAM. The example data included in the
  package are only for Spain and five summer days.
